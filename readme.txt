== Description ==

This is the adapted theme version of the Options Framework plugin.

The Options Framework makes it easy to include an options panel in any WordPress theme.  It was built so developers can concentrate on making the actual theme rather than spending time creating an options panel from scratch.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I build options for my own theme? =

Just drag the admin folder of this theme, options.php and functions.php into the theme of your choice.

options.php is a blueprint for how to work with options.  It includes an example of every option available in the panel and sample output in the theme.

You can also watch the video screencast I have at [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin).
